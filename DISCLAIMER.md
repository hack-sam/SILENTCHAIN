# DISCLAIMER

## Independent extension — not affiliated with PortSwigger

SILENTCHAIN Community Edition is an independent extension developed by Sn1perSecurity LLC.
It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by PortSwigger Ltd. PortSwigger has not
evaluated, tested, or approved this extension. "Burp Suite", "Burp", and the Burp logo are
trademarks of PortSwigger Ltd., used here for nominative descriptive purposes only.

## Authorized use only

SILENTCHAIN Community Edition is an offensive-security tool designed for authorized security
testing, penetration testing, and vulnerability research.

1. **You may not use this software for illegal or nefarious purposes**, or in any manner that
   violates the laws of your jurisdiction, the jurisdiction in which the software is running,
   the jurisdiction in which the software is targeting, or the United States of America.

2. **You agree not to scan a target in a manner that is considered unlawful or illegal, or
   that you do not have explicit written permission to do so.** Users are solely responsible
   for obtaining proper authorization before scanning any target system, network, or
   application.

## Burp AI credit consumption

When the **Burp AI** provider (the default) is selected, vulnerability analysis is performed
by PortSwigger's Burp AI service and each analysis consumes **Burp AI Credits** from your
PortSwigger account; the number of credits varies with request and response size. AI analysis
is **disabled by default** — enable it only after reviewing your credit balance and
consumption preferences.

## Data handling

SILENTCHAIN Community Edition processes HTTP requests and responses intercepted by Burp Suite.
The destination of that data depends on the AI provider you select:

- **Burp AI** — analyzed in-process by PortSwigger's Burp AI service under PortSwigger's
  data-handling terms.
- **Ollama** — analyzed by a local model; nothing leaves your machine.
- **Cloud providers** (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Azure OpenAI/Foundry) — request/response
  content for in-scope targets is transmitted to that provider's endpoint under its terms.

The extension's built-in **DataSanitizer** (enabled by default) redacts common secrets and
PII (API keys, bearer tokens, session cookies, emails) and neutralizes prompt-injection
patterns before content is sent to a cloud provider; it is not a guarantee. The extension
itself does not collect, store, or transmit any usage data, telemetry, or analytics, and
contacts no third-party endpoints other than the AI provider you configure. Users handling
regulated data (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR-restricted) should prefer a local provider (Ollama) and
review the relevant provider terms first. See **PRIVACY.md** for the full per-provider
data-residency notice.

or inability to use this software, even if Sn1perSecurity LLC has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

**Sn1perSecurity LLC disclaims all liability for misuse of this software. The user assumes
full responsibility for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.**
